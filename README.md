**TapOn app**
This app is created as a helper for my beer kegs. Each keg has an NFC tag that is linked to a keg page in the app.
This way you can see which keg is online/offline and what kind of beer its serving. 

As an extra you can write a review and favourite beers so I know which brews were successfull and which were not.

**ROADMAP**

1. upload react frontend to Google firebase

2. implement mongodb instead of postgres so I can host the database in the cloud

3. Add user authentication trough Auth0 (Auth Saas product)

4. Link reviews to users

5. Research how to upload nestjs application to either AWS or Firebase hosting
